# Performance Art 🎭⚡

A **playground for exploring web performance metrics** - where art meets analytics, and every interaction becomes a performance experiment.

## 🎯 What is Performance Art?

Performance Art is not just another web application. It's a **living laboratory** designed to help developers, designers, and performance enthusiasts understand, measure, and optimize web performance in real-time.

Think of it as your personal **performance testing sandbox** where you can:

- 🧪 Experiment with different performance optimization techniques
- 📊 Visualize real-time performance metrics
- 🎨 Create beautiful, performant user experiences
- 🔍 Debug performance bottlenecks
- 📈 Track performance improvements over time

## 🚀 Features

### Performance Metrics Dashboard

- **Core Web Vitals** monitoring (LCP, FID, CLS)
- **Real-time performance** tracking
- **Interactive charts** and visualizations
- **Performance budget** alerts

### Performance Testing Tools

- **Lighthouse CI** integration
- **WebPageTest** automation
- **Custom performance** benchmarks
- **A/B testing** for performance optimizations

### Developer Experience

- **Hot reloading** with performance insights
- **Performance debugging** tools
- **Bundle analyzer** integration
- **Performance regression** detection

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + Vite
- **Performance Monitoring**: Web Vitals API, Performance Observer
- **Build Tools**: Vite (optimized for fast development)
- **Testing**: Lighthouse, WebPageTest APIs
- **Visualization**: Chart.js, D3.js

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/performance-art.git
cd performance-art

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Preview the production build
npm run preview
```

## 📊 Performance Metrics We Track

### Core Web Vitals

- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: Measures loading performance
- **FID (First Input Delay)**: Measures interactivity
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: Measures visual stability

### Additional Metrics

- **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**
- **Speed Index**
- **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**

## 🧪 Performance Experiments

This playground includes various performance experiments you can run:

1. **Bundle Size Optimization**: Compare different bundling strategies
2. **Image Optimization**: Test various image formats and compression techniques
3. **Code Splitting**: Experiment with different code splitting approaches
4. **Caching Strategies**: Test various caching implementations
5. **Network Optimization**: Simulate different network conditions

## 📈 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Whether you want to:

- 🐛 Fix performance bugs
- ✨ Add new performance metrics
- 📚 Improve documentation
- 🎨 Enhance the UI/UX
- 🔬 Add new performance experiments

### How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-performance-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing performance feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-performance-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## 🎯 Performance Goals

Our target performance metrics:

- **LCP**: < 2.5s
- **FID**: < 100ms
- **CLS**: < 0.1
- **FCP**: < 1.8s
- **Speed Index**: < 3.4s

## 🔍 Debugging Performance Issues

### Common Performance Problems

- **Large bundle sizes**: Use the bundle analyzer
- **Slow images**: Check the image optimization tools
- **Layout shifts**: Monitor CLS in real-time
- **Slow interactions**: Profile with the performance debugger

### Performance Debugging Tools

- **Chrome DevTools** integration
- **Performance Timeline** visualization
- **Memory usage** monitoring
- **Network throttling** simulation
